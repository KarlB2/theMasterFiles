            <!--Editor's note:
                Hey, Kyle! I've been looking through your website and I have a couple of suggestions:
                First, concider taking a more friendly approach, like saying how greatful you are that the possible employers
                are even looking at the website in the first place and start by introducing yourself. Also, try using lower case letter's in the paragraphs,
                it can make people feel like they're being yelled and might diswayd possible employers. Finally, maybe correct the title
                of the "kyle is the best for job" section. Fixing your grammar and using proper capitalisation can lead to a more professional look
                -->
            <h2>MY GREATEST INVENTION!</h2>
            <p class="normal_text">I know what you might be thinking. "WHAT? KYLE??? Of ALL the people in the world why
                would I, a sain human being, hire Kyle? I'm never going to hire that insufferable fool." I've heard it
                all
                too many times before.
                It's a mistake many people make when choosing candidates. They often overlook the Kyles of the world.
                Let ME
                let you in on a little business secret: NEVER. PASS. UP. A KYLE!!!</p>

            <!--Editor's note:
            Hey, Kyle! I'd like to add a couple of suggestions to this sections:
            Firstly, trying cutting out the 5 paragraph essay about your pet goldfish Mickey and try focusing on cartaring to their needs. I've made a simple navigation bar to help you get started on making a multipage website. Another suggestion is to make sure that you give a preview what the employers can expect when going into this site. Also, porfolio is one word. You don't need to add a space.
            -->
            <h2>CODING STUFF</h2>
            <p class="normal_text">
                As a professional person, I've made this website to accommodate your employery needs. Such as a
                navigation bar on the top of your screen. That's right, I'm just that good. I've work for MIT, NASA, and
                IoT. And you can find more ABOUT that in the ABOUT page. But JUST because I've worked for fancy tech
                acronyms, doesn't mean that I'm the best. No, I'm the best because of my MASSIVE and IMPRESSIVE coding
                skills. And you'll find ALL of my greatest projects in the PortFolio page.

            <!--Editor's Note:
            Hey, Kyle. Maybe try reframing you mission statement into something more constructive. I personally enjoy karaoke as much as the next person, but please don't talk about the noodle incident in your mission statement. Alternatively, try focusing on job related goals, like writing code. Speaking of which, I see you have also misspelled a word. You are you using the wrong spelling of "right". It's "I wright code", not "I right code"

            <h2>KID NAPPING MY EDITOR'S FAMILY</h2>
            <p class="normal_text">
                MY MISSION is simple: <br>
                Write lots of code. Vats of code. Oceans of code. Too much code, in fact. So much code that I'm not even
                sure
                how it got there.
                I've been working 24 hours, 7 minutes and 365 seconds of everyday. I've spelt it out for you, THAT'S how
                comitted I am to writting code. If you think you should doubt my abilties, let me ask you this. Do you
                still
                use a light bulb? Well, my friend, you have your answer write there.
