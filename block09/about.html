            <h2>MY TRAGIC BACKSTORY</h2>
            <p class="normal_text">From a younge age I WAS the underdog. Everyone LOVED me because I was the greatest.
                BUT EVERYONE HATED me because of how greatest I was. Because of this I was an outcast. The ONLY people
                who truly understood me, were my parents, who helped me become the person I am. When I left home to go
                to college, they supported me. With their small loan of a million dollars I was ready to take on the
                world. But the world was cruel and dispite my best efforts, the teacher's expelled me because of few bad
                grades. Or at least that's what they'll say, but they only kicked me out because I was better than them

            <!--Editor's note:
            Hey, Kyle! I'd like to add a couple of suggestions to this sections:
            Firstly, trying cutting out the 5 paragraph essay about your pet goldfish Mickey and try focusing on cartaring to their needs. I've made a simple navigation bar to help you get started on making a multipage website. Another suggestion is to make sure that you give a preview what the employers can expect when going into this site. Also, porfolio is one word. You don't need to add a space.
            -->
            <h2>HOW SUCCESFUL I'VE BEEN</h2>
            <p class="normal_text">
                As a professional person, I've made this website to accommodate your employery needs. Such as a
                navigation bar on the top of your screen. That's right, I'm just that good. I've work for MIT, NASA, and
                IoT. And you can find more ABOUT that in the ABOUT page. But JUST because I've worked for fancy tech
                acronyms, doesn't mean that I'm the best. No, I'm the best because of my MASSIVE and IMPRESSIVE coding
                skills. And you'll find ALL of my greatest projects in the PortFolio page.

            <!--Editor's Note:
            Hey, Kyle. Maybe try reframing you mission statement into something more constructive. I personally enjoy karaoke as much as the next person, but please don't talk about the noodle incident in your mission statement. Alternatively, try focusing on job related goals, like writing code. Speaking of which, I see you have also misspelled a word. You are you using the wrong spelling of "right". It's "I wright code", not "I right code"
            -->
            <h2>CODING EXPERIENCES</h2>
            <p class="normal_text">
                MY MISSION is simple: <br>
                Write lots of code. Vats of code. Oceans of code. Too much code, in fact. So much code that I'm not even
                sure
                how it got there.
                I've been working 24 hours, 7 minutes and 365 seconds of everyday. I've spelt it out for you, THAT'S how
                comitted I am to writting code. If you think you should doubt my abilties, let me ask you this. Do you
                still
                use a light bulb? Well, my friend, you have your answer write there.
